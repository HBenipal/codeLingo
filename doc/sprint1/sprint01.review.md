 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 2/14/2025
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

- Created a Home Page
- Login and Register Implementation
- Discussion Board UI

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- Team Work, Ethic, and Consistency: The way the project is organized and tasks are distributed among team members makes it extremely easy to develop the product.

- Follow Git Flow practices: Team members consistently follow git flow practices which resulted in clean repository with few/none merge conflicts, helping team productivity

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

- High Learning curve: Many members found it difficult to start setting up and begin coding, and is still getting familiar with new technologies leading to slow progression

- Lack of in-person discussion: We found it hard to find a time for the whole group to meet with each other in-person and discuss important factors of the project, which causes some miscommunications and slow project finalization speed.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- Need to refractor most UI components to match drafted Figma designs
- Need to finalize backend design (classes)


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

- Implemented Login and register

- Setup Firebase (Realtime database and firebase authentication)

- Created HomePage for the app
- Complete system design diagram
- Develop MVP of discussion board
- Complete sprint 1 required documents



#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- All planned tasks were completed.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Developing main lesson pages, alongside starting to setup AI (gpt) integration

- Utilizing external APIs (leetcode, github) to add functionality for leetcode questions and uploading answers to github

- Finish implementing discussion board
