# Release Plan - Sprint 1

## Release Name: Sprint 1

## Release Objectives
### Specific Goals
- Develop the foundational infrastructure for CodeLingo.
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Set up core UI components and establish the frontend framework.
- Deploy a working MVP with basic functionality.

### Metrics for Measurement
- Successful user registration and login (measured via authentication logs).
- Core UI components implemented (tracked via Jira tickets completion rate).
- Deployment of the MVP (verified through CI/CD pipeline logs).

## Release Scope
### Included Features
- **User Authentication**: Implement Firebase authentication with OAuth 2.0.
- **Frontend Framework Setup**: Establish React (TypeScript) project structure.
- **Landing Page**: Develop an initial homepage with navigation.
- **Database Setup**: Configure Firebase Firestore for storing user data.
- **Discussion Board**: Create a page to discuss general problems, alongside FAQs.

### Excluded Features
- **Competition Mode**: Real-time coding challenges will be added in future sprints.
- **AI-Generated Challenges**: The AI-driven challenge system will not be part of this release.

### Bug Fixes
- None, as this is the initial release.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Ensure the system supports at least 100 concurrent users.
- Setup automated testing for authentication and basic UI components.
- Implement basic security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

## Dependencies and Limitations
### External Dependencies
- Firebase for authentication and database management.
- React and TailwindCSS for frontend development.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline setup.

### Known Limitations
- Limited feature set as this is the first sprint.
- No real-time competitive coding or AI-driven challenge generation.

## Deployment Plan
### Steps to Carry Out the Deployment
1. Merge the Sprint 1 branch into the `main` branch.
2. Run automated tests to ensure stability.
3. Deploy to Firebase Hosting using GitHub Actions.
4. Verify deployment success via system health checks.

### PIV (Post Implementation Verification) Instruction
- Verify user authentication through test accounts.
- Check database entries for registered users.
- Ensure UI components render correctly on different devices.

### Post Deployment Monitoring
- Track authentication logs to ensure users can sign up and log in successfully.
- Monitor Firebase analytics for performance issues.
- Address UI/UX feedback from early testers.

### Rollback Strategy
- If critical bugs are found, revert to the last stable commit and redeploy.
- Disable new user registrations temporarily if authentication fails.
- Use Firebase rollback features if database issues occur.
