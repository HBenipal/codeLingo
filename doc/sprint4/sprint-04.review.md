### ‚úÖ Decisions that turned out well

- **Critical Path Planning:** Mapping dependencies helped us avoid mid-sprint delays and ensured smoother task handoffs.
- **Pair Programming on High-Complexity Tasks:** Improved code quality and reduced cycle time for critical modules like progress tracking.
- **Daily Standups & Communication:** Helped identify blockers early and allowed dynamic task reassignment when necessary.
- **Backend Planning at Sprint Start:** Finalizing the database schema early made it easier to build features that depended on it, such as tracking user lesson progress.
