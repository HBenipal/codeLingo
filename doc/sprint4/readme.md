# README â€“ Sprint 4 (NFR Submission)

As per the project requirements, a `NFR.pdf` only needs to be submitted if a team has made **modifications or improvements** to their selected non-functional requirements (NFRs) after Sprint 3.

Our team has **fully implemented all three of our selected NFRs**, and no further changes were made in Sprint 4. Below is a summary of each NFR and how it was addressed:

---

## âœ… 1. Usability
**What We Did:**
- Designed a clean and intuitive UI for both students and admins using consistent layout and interaction patterns.
- Ensured keyboard accessibility and clear error messages for user input.
- Included responsive design for compatibility with desktop and mobile views.
- Simplified onboarding with quick access to multiplayer games, private tokens, and lesson review.

**Result:**  
Users are able to navigate and use the web app smoothly without needing instructions, which directly supports our educational goal of lowering barriers to learning how to code.

---

## âœ… 2. Security
**What We Did:**
- Used Firebase Authentication to securely manage signups/logins and protect user credentials.
- Applied password hashing and authentication guards on protected routes.
- Prevented unauthorized access to private game sessions via access tokens.
- Implemented proper API authorization to restrict sensitive operations (e.g., admin actions).

**Result:**  
User data is protected, and access to critical components is limited to authorized users, aligning with modern best practices for web application security.

---

## âœ… 3. Availability
**What We Did:**
- Deployed the application on a stable cloud platform (AWS EC2) with high uptime.
- Ensured that key features such as login, game sessions, lesson content, and review functionality are always available.
- Designed the system to support simultaneous multiplayer sessions and real-time collaboration with minimal downtime.

**Result:**  
Our platform remained up and functional throughout testing and demo sessions. Core features are available 24/7, ensuring accessibility for all users.

### ðŸš« Why No `NFR.pdf` is Included

Since all of our selected NFRs were fully implemented by the end of Sprint 3 and remained unchanged in Sprint 4, **no NFR resubmission is necessary**.

> âœ… **Nothing further is required for the NFR submission.**
